Alexandros Tsiogas C20336236 - Final Year Project Interim Application

Important! - This application requires a Spotify acount to run correctly.
If you would like to log in with your own Spotify account, the account's email address needs to be added to 
an application whitelist. Please feel free to contact me with your email and
I will add you to this whitelist, allowing you to log in with your own Spotify account.
Otherwise, please use this dummy account - USERNAME: alextsiogas.fyp@gmail.com   PASSWORD: Iosgr2001

This application was developed and tested in Visual Studio Code. These steps will describe how to run
the applcation in VSCode.

Once this folder has been extracted, open it in an editor in VSCode. The spotify file "spotify.py" 
should be ran, using the "Run Code" button in the top right of the screen. A link to a URL (shoule be http://127.0.0.1:5000)
will display in the terminal - when followed, this link should display the Spotify Authentication page.
Log in using any Spotify account, and you should access the application.

If the app doesn't run on first attempt, Flask and spotipy may need to be installed - this can be 
done with by running the commands "pip install flask" and "pip install spotipy" in the terminal
It is possible other packages like  pandas or sklearn arent installed. These can be installed with:
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn

Please contact me if any other issues are encountered running the application.
