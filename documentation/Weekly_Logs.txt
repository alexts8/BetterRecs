This week, I worked further on my application's core functionality,
creating a page that displays playlists as clickable links, that show a playlist's contents when clicked.
This will be key functionality in my app as gathering song data is a critical part of creating the machine learning model.
I continued researching ML models, and after comparing various options I decided to work with a 
"content based filtering" model - further research on this to be done next week. 
In my meeting with my supervisor we discussed my progress, and I was encouraged to focus on design before
going much further with code at this stage - I plan to create use case diagrams
 and further design documents for my app this week, while continuing my background research.
