This week, I worked further on my application's core functionality,
creating a page that displays playlists as clickable links, that show a playlist's contents when clicked.
This will be key functionality in my app as gathering song data is a critical part of creating the machine learning model.
I continued researching ML models, and after comparing various options I decided to work with a 
"content based filtering" model - further research on this to be done next week. 
In my meeting with my supervisor we discussed my progress, and I was encouraged to focus on design before
going much further with code at this stage - I plan to create use case diagrams
 and further design documents for my app this week, while continuing my background research.

This week, i took a step back from coding and put more focus on designing my app.
I drafted multiple diagrams, including use-case, software architecture, and flow diagrams.
I plan on using these as the basis of my app's design going forward, and all my coding will be
done in adherence with the design.
In my meeting with my supervisor, we discussed what I can do in terms of research and design going forward,
and I was encouraged to think about the interim demo, and what I want to have ready for it.
Hence this week I plan on progressing with my code to have more demoable items ready, and I plan on starting my interim report.

This week, I started on my interim report, completing the first two chapters.
As part of this, I did extensive research on existing solutions to my problem and
on different technologies. I also began constructing my ML model.
It is still in the very early stages, I'm currently only focused on data extraction 
and cleaning. No meeting was held with my supervisor as it's review week.
this week I will continue designing and building my ML model and I will
work on the interim report.
